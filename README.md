Prediction of house price 


My project relates to housing industry. I propose to study price of house.
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, (USA) which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.


I used linear regression to building model after deep data exploration and feature engineering.
I created World map using ggplot2 of the coordinates of houses.
I created clusters ( on house prices ) and visualized them according to coordinates (zipcode not used, coordinates have more information than zipcode).
