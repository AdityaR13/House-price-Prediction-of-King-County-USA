3.3 Model

We analyzed the research question using linear regression models. We established effect of size, parking, interior, location, local area, quality, ambiance on price of house and with data visualization and running few tests we came up with simplest model of our price prediction. We regressed the price accounting few variables.

Price of house  =  beta0  +  beta1 * sqft_living  +  beta2 * bedrooms  +      
                 beta3 * bathrooms  +  beta4 * grade  +  beta5 * sqft_above   
                +  beta6 * zipcode

We estimated Model 1A, using linear least squares.


3.4 Results

We found empirical support for H1. Price depended on size, interior, quality, outer areas and location of house.
This regression analysis also yielded beta1>0, with p <0.01 etc.




4 Conclusion

This paper was motivated by the need for research that could improve our understanding of how multiple vicinity factors influences the pricing in the housing industry. The unique contribution of this paper is that we investigated the price at which houses are sold by housing industry and related to what factors they select prices for various houses and how to predict prices using the past data for future.

This research has some important managerial implications. We can find cheapest house according to needs and on a seller’s perspective, we can decide which house will generate maximum profit with short-term visualization.
